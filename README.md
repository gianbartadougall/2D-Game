# 2D-Game

This is a 2D game similar to Mario that I created for fun. In the game their are slimes which are mobs that if you touch you die. To kill 
them you shoot them with your gun.

Features
- Add in new enemy creatures easily
- All creatures are animated
- Enemy creatures have basic AI
- Player has basic movement(running, turning, jumping)
- Realistic gravity
- Player can shoot
- settings, menu and respawn screens
- collision detection
- Added rendering efficiencies e.g: If an enemy is out of sight, it won't rendnder or do any calculations (this can be changed in settings)
